- What I did is I check if the matrix is empty by checking its size
- If the size is 0 then return imput matrix 

- Then I check if it is square by checking its shape 
- if the number of rows not equals columns, then it is not square which will return imput matrix

- Finally I use return the transpose version within the negate one which will return the out matrix that is transposed and negated
- I also include a longer one which write out by step in the comment below the return
